# 2D Physics simulation involving Sun-Earth orbitals
## Powered by the Piston engine

This program visually simulates how the Earth orbits around the Sun, with realistic gravitational forces calculated from realistic masses.

The resolution of the movement is dependent on the time step($\delta t). If $\delta t is smaller, the movement will be smoother and more accurate(because this program is based on differential equations, whose resolution is dependent on $\delta t).
